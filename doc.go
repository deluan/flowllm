// package pipelm is a GoLang framework for developing applications that leverage the power of language models.
// It uses composability and chain of responsibility patterns, and offers tools to access LLMs, build prompts,
// and access Vector Stores. The package also includes parsers and database integrations, making it an
// ideal solution for developers working with language models.
//
// This package is heavily inspired by the LangChain project, but tries to be more idiomatic for Go projects.
